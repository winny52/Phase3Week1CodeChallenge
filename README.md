## Introduction

The repository above contains solutions to the challenges  below;
# Converting 12-hour time to 24-hour time
 File name = clock.py
 ## Description
The convert_to_24_hour function is a utility that takes a time in 12-hour format (with hours ranging from 1 to 12, minutes from 0 to 59, and periods "am" or "pm") as input and converts it into the corresponding 24-hour format. The result is returned as a four-digit string.

  ## Examples

    convert_to_24_hour(8, 30, "am") returns "0830"
    convert_to_24_hour(3, 45, "pm") returns "1545"

# Two numbers are positive.
 File name = positiveno.py
 ## Description

The two_positive function is designed to determine whether exactly two out of three given integer values are positive numbers (greater than zero). It takes three integer arguments: a, b, and c. The function returns True if exactly two of the three integers are positive, and False otherwise.

 ## Examples

    two_positive(2, 4, -3) returns True because two values (2 and 4) are positive.
    two_positive(3, 9, 4) returns False because all three values are positive.

# Consonant value calculator 
File name = consonant.py
  ## Description

This Python script provides functions to calculate and identify the highest value of consonants within a given string. It includes methods to determine consonant characters, calculate their values based on their position in the alphabet, and find the highest cumulative consonant value in the string.
 ## Examples

 Input string: "winny"

    w' has a consonant value of 23.
    'i' is not a consonant.
    'n' has a consonant value of 14.
    'n' has a consonant value of 14.
    'y' has a consonant value of 25.

The cumulative values are 23, 0, 14, 28, and 53. Therefore, the script outputs the highest cumulative consonant value, which is 53 for the input string "winny".
