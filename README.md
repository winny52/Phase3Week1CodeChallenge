# Converting 12-hour time to 24-hour time
 File name = clock.py
 ## Description
The convert_to_24_hour function is a utility that takes a time in 12-hour format (with hours ranging from 1 to 12, minutes from 0 to 59, and periods "am" or "pm") as input and converts it into the corresponding 24-hour format. The result is returned as a four-digit string.

  ## Examples

    convert_to_24_hour(8, 30, "am") returns "0830"
    convert_to_24_hour(3, 45, "pm") returns "1545"

# Two numbers are positive.
 ## Description

The two_positive function is designed to determine whether exactly two out of three given integer values are positive numbers (greater than zero). It takes three integer arguments: a, b, and c. The function returns True if exactly two of the three integers are positive, and False otherwise.

 ## Examples

    two_positive(2, 4, -3) returns True because two values (2 and 4) are positive.
    two_positive(3, 9, 4) returns False because all three values are positive.

# Consonant value
